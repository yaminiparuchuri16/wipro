Employ(Empno,Ename,DeptCode,DeptName,Gender,Salary,ProjCode,Hours) 

First Normal Form : A table said to be in first normal form, each cell precisely contains only one value (Atomic Values) 

Example : 

  E100,Uday,D001,DOtnet,Male,88423,{p001,p123},{88,111} 

By Applying 1NF, 

E100,Uday,D001,DOtnet,Male,88423,p001,88 
E100,Uday,D001,DOtnet,Male,88423,p123,111 

INSERT : The department of the particular employee cannot be recorded until the employee is assigned a project. 

UPDATE : The DeptCode, DeptName Repeated Multiple Times, if any employ moves to another dept, the change needs to be reflected in all corresponding records

DELETE : If any employee resigns his job, the dept and project details are also deleted. 

So, 1NF Inadequate 

Second Normal Form : A table said to be in 2NF, at first it must be in 1NF, and each key needs to functionally depend on whole key but not part of the key. 

Guidelines : 
_____________

	(i) Find and remove attributes that are functionally depend on whole 		key
	(ii) Group the remaining attributes. 

By applying 2NF

Employ(Empno,Ename,DeptCode,DeptName,Gender,Salary,ProjCode,Hours) 

Empno -> Ename (Yes)
      -> DeptCode (Yes)
      -> DeptName (Yes)
      -> Gender (Yes)
      -> Salary (Yes)
      -> ProjCode (No)
      -> Hours (No) 

Employ(Empno+,Ename,DeptCode,DeptName,Gender,Salary) 
Project(Empno-,ProjCode,Hours) 
	{ProjCode + Empno} 

Third Normal Form : A table said to be in 3NF, at first it must be in 2NF and each cell needs to depend on whole key but not transitively. 

Employ(Empno+,Ename,DeptCode,DeptName,Gender,Salary) 

Insert : The deptCode, DeptName cannot be entered until employ is there 

Update : DeptCode repeated multiple times, if any depthead moves to another, the change needs to be reflected in all corresponding records 

Delete : IF any employ resigns the dept head records also lost

Guidelines : 

	-> Find and remove attributes that are transitively depend on 			particular key
	-> Group the remaining attributes


Empno+,Ename,DeptCode,DeptName,Gender,Salary

Empno -> Ename (Yes)
      -> DeptCode (No)
      -> DeptName (No)
      -> Gender (Yes)
      -> Salary (No) 

By applying 3NF,

Dept(DeptCode,DeptName)
Employ(Empno,DeptCode,Ename,Gender,Salary)
Project(ProjCode,Empno,Hours) 

Keypoints : 
_____________

1NF -> Atomic Values

2NF -> Functional Dependency

3NF -> Transitive Dependency
