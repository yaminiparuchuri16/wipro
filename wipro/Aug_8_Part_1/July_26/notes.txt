Arrays are static data structures, means once they are assigned we cannot alter the size,
so if you want to store data irrespective of size, then we need the help of collections. 

Collections can grow to any size unlike arrays. 

java.util is package, that which allows you to deal with collections. 

Collections will store data in Object format. 

Scanner 

There are 3 top level interfaces we have in collections as

1) List

2) Set

3) SortedSet 


How to ensure a class not to be inherited further. 

Make the class as final 

final class cannot be inherited

final method cannot be overrided

final variable cannot be modified

There are some immutable classes as String, Boolean, Byte, Integer, Sort etc... We can create any immutable classes by creating final class that have final data members. 

StringBuilder : It is a mutable class, that which allows you modify, add ,delete
the content and you can add number of lines also to that. 

void show(int x) {
...
...
...
}

show();
show(12);
show(12,5);


varargs : A method that which contains varying arguments. As instead of passing 
standard arguments, we need to pass any no.of arguments at runtime, can be defined 
as varargs.

You can define varargs by using ...

void show(int...x) {
...
...
}

show();
show(12);
show(12,5);

Set interface : Used to eliminate duplicate entries from the given list of values. 

HashSet and LinkedHashSet are falling under Set interface. 

The diff. between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is 

HashSet prints the data in random order, where LinkedHashSet display's data w.r.t. Insertion Order

SortedSet : This interface allows you to display values w.r.t. Sorted Order. 
TreeSet is falling under SortedSet interface.
