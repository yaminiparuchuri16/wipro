1) What is GIT 

Git is basically a version control system which allows you to manage multiple versions of documents, programs and project code. 

When team of people working on same project, everytime we need to get working code to be ready, then git is the best solution to be provide.

Git purely focuses on concurrent work, merging changes 

Git hub contains 

1) Working Directory : It is the actual directory of git repo

2) Staging Area : This area contains the files ready to commit as all working code to be added to the staging area

3) Local Repository : Allows you to commit the changes in your local system.

4) Remote Repository : Allows you to commit changes in remote as authorized person can access. 

How to add to staging area is

git add .

How to add to Local repository : 

git commit -m "git notes updated"

How to add the files to remote repository

git push origin <branch_name> 

assume, the branch name is main then 

git push origin main

git diff : Identifies the changes between old commit (vs) new commit

git status : Used to identify the current repo status. 

git checkout filename : Used to remove the changes before last commit. 

git reset HEAD file_name : Used to unstage the file to working directory.
